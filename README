This is a fork of MonoMac but with .NET Standard support so it can run on .NET Core.

This will be maintained until such time as Xamarin.Mac runs on .NET Core as it is a much more mature runtime for macOS.

Building:

To build, you must be running on macOS with mono installed, then run the following on the command line:

```bash
./build.sh
```
